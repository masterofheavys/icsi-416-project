Stubby: Ash has many short range normals, making midrange and close range combat difficult.
Low Damage Without Meter: Without Sans-Culotte, Ash tends to deal low amounts of damage. His zoning game is also predicated on keeping people out, meaning he tends not to have much opportunity for big damage anyways.
Some Dexterity Required: Confirming into Sans-Culotte combos can be difficult, and actually performing them more so. Ash players must have good fundamentals and great execution to consistently have access to his high damage.
Charge Character: Requires charge for many of his specials, which removes access to meterless reversal at times and limits punish options.
Limited Mixup: Ash has mediocre mixup at best. He relies a lot on making opponents come to him, so forcing mistakes is a must.
